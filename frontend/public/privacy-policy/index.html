  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: November 8, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We collect information you provide directly to us when you create an account, add teammates, upload
    or paste transcripts, create tasks, or communicate with us. This may include your name, email address,
    workspace details, meeting metadata, and any other information you choose to provide.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also collect information automatically when you use Plan AI, including log data, device
    information, usage analytics, and cookies. Meeting recordings or transcript files you upload are
    stored securely for processing and retrieval within your workspace.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve Plan AI, to communicate with you,
    to personalize task recommendations, and to develop new automation features.
  </p>
  <p>
    Transcript snippets may be processed by AI models to generate summaries, tasks, themes, and insights.
    We do not sell your data to third parties.
  </p>

  <h3>2.1 Connected Integrations</h3>
  <p>
    When you connect optional integrations (such as calendar, conferencing, or ticketing tools), we may
    collect metadata needed to sync agenda items, attach recordings, or push generated tasks. We only
    access the scopes you authorize and store integration tokens securely.
  </p>
  <h3>2.2 AI Processing</h3>
  <p>
    Plan AI uses hosted and third-party AI models to process transcripts, detect speakers, cluster themes,
    and recommend action items. These services process your data solely to deliver Plan AI features and are
    bound by confidentiality obligations.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not transfer or disclose your information to third parties for purposes other than the ones
    provided in this policy. We may share your information with service providers who perform services on
    our behalf, such as hosting, AI processing, data analysis, and customer support.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also share your information as required by law, to protect our rights, or in connection
    with a merger, sale, or transfer of our assets.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Security procedures are in place to protect the confidentiality of your data. We use encryption to
    protect your information, restrict access to transcript content to authorized staff, and maintain
    administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, use, or
    disclosure.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so
    we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    We store your personal information for a period of time that is consistent with our business
    purposes. We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill
    the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or
    permitted by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Transcript Data Retention:</strong> Uploaded transcripts, generated tasks, and AI summaries are retained while
    your workspace remains active. When you delete a transcript, disconnect an integration, or close your Plan AI
    account, related data is deleted or anonymized in accordance with our retention schedules.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the data retention period expires for a given type of data, we will delete or destroy it.
    You may request for your data to be deleted by contacting us at privacy@blueberrybytes.com or
    by using the Data Deletion page on our website.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information,
    such as the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your information.
  </p>
  <p>
    To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information provided in the "Contact Us"
    section below.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will
    notify you by email or by posting a notice on our website prior to the change becoming
    effective.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our privacy practices, please contact
    us at projects@blueberrybytes.com or via your Plan AI workspace support channel.
