    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: November 8, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Plan AI
      transcript-to-task platform operated by BlueberryBytes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with
      these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, team members, and organizations who access and
      operate the Plan AI Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with
      any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      When you create an account with us, you must provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date
      information. Team accounts rely on assigned workspace owners. Failure to do so constitutes a breach
      of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your access to Plan AI boards,
      transcripts, and automations.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for
      any activities or actions under your password. We recommend enabling MFA when available.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately
      upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Content & Transcript Data</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service allows you to upload meeting recordings, copy/paste transcripts, add task metadata,
      and generate insights. You are responsible for the content that you post to the Service, including
      its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.
    </p>
    <p>
      By posting content to the Service, you grant us the right to process transcripts, generate AI
      summaries, produce recommended tasks, and surface insights to authorized collaborators within your
      workspace.
    </p>
    <p>
      You represent and warrant that: (i) the content is yours or you have the right to use it and grant
      us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, (ii) transcripts shared with Plan AI may be
      processed by AI models for task generation, and (iii) the posting of your content on or through the
      Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any
      other rights of any person.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The Service and its original content (excluding content provided by users), including AI prompts,
      task generation flows, transcript parsing algorithms, features, and functionality are and will
      remain the exclusive property of BlueberryBytes and its licensors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and
      foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any
      product or service without the prior written consent of BlueberryBytes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Links To Other Web Sites</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled
      by BlueberryBytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BlueberryBytes has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy
      policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and
      agree that BlueberryBytes shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any
      damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on
      any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such web sites or services.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Workspace Suspension & Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may terminate or suspend your account or workspace immediately, without prior notice or liability,
      for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms or misuse AI
      resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to
      terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Limitation Of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      In no event shall BlueberryBytes, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or
      affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages,
      including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses,
      resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any
      conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) AI-generated recommendations that are
      adopted without human validation; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your
      transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any
      other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a
      revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking
      effect. Material changes may include adjustments to AI processing, retention practices, or pricing.
    </p>
    <p>
      By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree
      to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the
      Service.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
