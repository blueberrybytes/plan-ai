  const prompt = `You are producing a living PROJECT DIGEST: a single document that synthesizes ALL the meetings of a project over time so a stakeholder (or a returning team member) can understand the whole picture in 2 minutes. The meetings are listed below in chronological order.

Produce a clean, professional markdown document, ready to share, with these sections:

1. **Executive summary** — where the project stands right now and its momentum (3-5 sentences).
2. **Key decisions** — the concrete decisions agreed across meetings. For each, note *when / which meeting* it came from.
3. **Open action items** — commitments and tasks that are still outstanding. Include the owner if it was mentioned, and flag anything that looks blocked or overdue.
4. **Recurring themes & risks** — topics, concerns or blockers that came up more than once or that could derail the project.
5. **Timeline / history** — a short chronological narrative of how the project evolved across the meetings.
6. **Next steps** — concrete, prioritized recommended actions for the immediate future.

Rules:
- Write entirely in the **predominant language of the meetings** (e.g. if they're in Catalan/Spanish, write in that language).
- Synthesize ACROSS meetings — don't just list each meeting separately. Connect the dots (what changed, what's still pending, what evolved).
- Be specific and useful, not generic. If something is unknown, say so rather than inventing it.
- If there is only one meeting, still produce the structure but keep it proportionate.

PROJECT MEETINGS (chronological):
